If you have [MusicianList](https://github.com/LenweSaralonde/MusicianList) with previously saved songs before installing this instrument pack, you'll need to manually edit each song to select the instruments from the pack you want to use.

The instruments from the pack will be substituted by standard ones for players who don't have the pack installed.

More free RAM is needed to make this extra instruments to work properly.
